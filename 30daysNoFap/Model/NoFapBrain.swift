I started out small, not often some years ago, and got to the point where I would do it daily, taking a few hours of my time to watch some horrible porn. Even the orgasms wouldn't elicit anything other than a nose exhale. That was the first key point for me. This act that I spent hours from my daily life doing, in search of a high, wasn't doing me any good. Even the enjoyable part was no longer there. And as if my mind knew that, it kept me trying it multiple times a day, to no avail.\n\nThat was when almost 4 months ago I started dating for the first time. It is an amazing experience to share a relationship with someone, and I treasure her and this thing we have together so so much. Now, when I started dating her, I thought to myself: 'Well, this is it. The days of being an incel are over. I don't need porn anymore. I can be with her, and that's enough.'\n\nAnd to my utmost satisfaction, that was true. For about a month.\n\nThen, as if I were having some screwed up deja vu, I started out small. Some Instagram models casually popping up on my feed. Some sexy pictures while browsing the web. Amazingly, that was enough to set me off. A few days later without sex, it happened again. And a few days later, again. And again. And my desires were getting specific and 'darker' again. Until it got to the point where I would just Fap today when I knew I was going to have sex the tomorrow. If I were in control, I would have simply waited for the next day. But I couldn't.\n\nShe does know I have struggled with porn and masturbation for many years, and last time we spoke of this, I was still in my bliss phase. I feel ashamed that I got back to these old ways, and I don't want her to think that she's not good enough (we are both very inexperienced with this stuff), or that I don't desire her. I do. A lot. And that's the second key point: This is hurting our relationship without she knowing. I don't wanna make her suffer.\n\nSo, those two key points make up one thing: Porn isn't doing me any good, and it's hurting this very special thing I have. It only brings me negative things. I have to change. I will change. I will make her proud.\n\nSo I started seriously, for the first time, on Friday. And I just got through my 4th day. It doesn't feel as good as I thought I would. I'm looking forward to that first week milestone. And I know I can do at least one month, because I have done it twice jokingly. I plan to do the full 90 days. I wanna see myself free from these shackles that have bound me for the last 7 years.\n\nSo, here I fucking go.\n\nu/Eantropix, reddit")

And it’s not possible TO be prepared for it either. Going through a PMO detox means that, likely for most of our adult (and pre-adult lives) we’ve had the PMO needle in our veins, blurring our realities, poisoning our cognitive abilities. And one sudden moment of clarity — the acknowledgement of the problem, and the potential future without the problem — does not prepare one for this process.

Had a lot of dreams with hot girls in them and in the dreams im trying to have sex with them. Came to the conclusion its wet dreams but so far not had a nightfall, so Ive decided to just let them come and go as they please. Ill control my waking hours with not relapsing and my subconscious will go on doing whatever the f its doing. The dreams dont bother me at all. Another thing after 2 weeks of thoughtfulness, meditation & change of habits is that i feel that i dont try to live my life like life is a climb on the ladder. I got stuck in traffic yesterday & i put on some nice music, did some breathing exercises and actually kinda enjoyed being stuck there for a while. Not racing towards goals that are always moving on front of you on the horizon but being more 'here and now' is a nice new mindset that was always something i brushed off as hippie shit, but now im realizing that if im unable to enjoy the state i am in RIGHT NOW, how the f am i going to enjoy myself in the coming days, weeks or even years from now? Its hard to type it out for me in a good fashion since im nowhere near a monk or spiritual guide, but something in me feels like it has kinda 'clicked' and my days just keep floating on in a very enjoyable fashion.\n\nfor those that haven't already, try meditation!\n\nu/throwaway786324, reddit"),

I took some time alone, took a shower and spent five minutes meditating and I feel a lot better now.\n\nAfter two weeks I feel more confident again. I also feel stronger emotions, which I consider a good thing.

However, that's not what I want anymore. I just want a girl who cares about me. I imagine the feeling of spending time with a girl you genuinely love is far better than a million pmo sessions. Honestly, you could tell me that sex will never be an option, and I wouldn't care. There's just so much more to life.\n\nOf course, that's only if I end up in a relationship someday. Even if that never happens, I'll be fine. I'm doing this for myself, not for girls. It's just a thought that I had.\n\n")
