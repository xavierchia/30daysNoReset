I started out small, not often some years ago, and got to the point where I would do it daily, taking a few hours of my time to watch some horrible porn. Even the orgasms wouldn't elicit anything other than a nose exhale. That was the first key point for me. This act that I spent hours from my daily life doing, in search of a high, wasn't doing me any good. Even the enjoyable part was no longer there. And as if my mind knew that, it kept me trying it multiple times a day, to no avail.\n\nThat was when almost 4 months ago I started dating for the first time. It is an amazing experience to share a relationship with someone, and I treasure her and this thing we have together so so much. Now, when I started dating her, I thought to myself: 'Well, this is it. The days of being an incel are over. I don't need porn anymore. I can be with her, and that's enough.'\n\nAnd to my utmost satisfaction, that was true. For about a month.\n\nThen, as if I were having some screwed up deja vu, I started out small. Some Instagram models casually popping up on my feed. Some sexy pictures while browsing the web. Amazingly, that was enough to set me off. A few days later without sex, it happened again. And a few days later, again. And again. And my desires were getting specific and 'darker' again. Until it got to the point where I would just Fap today when I knew I was going to have sex the tomorrow. If I were in control, I would have simply waited for the next day. But I couldn't.\n\nShe does know I have struggled with porn and masturbation for many years, and last time we spoke of this, I was still in my bliss phase. I feel ashamed that I got back to these old ways, and I don't want her to think that she's not good enough (we are both very inexperienced with this stuff), or that I don't desire her. I do. A lot. And that's the second key point: This is hurting our relationship without she knowing. I don't wanna make her suffer.\n\nSo, those two key points make up one thing: Porn isn't doing me any good, and it's hurting this very special thing I have. It only brings me negative things. I have to change. I will change. I will make her proud.\n\nSo I started seriously, for the first time, on Friday. And I just got through my 4th day. It doesn't feel as good as I thought I would. I'm looking forward to that first week milestone. And I know I can do at least one month, because I have done it twice jokingly. I plan to do the full 90 days. I wanna see myself free from these shackles that have bound me for the last 7 years.\n\nSo, here I fucking go.\n\nu/Eantropix, reddit")

And it’s not possible TO be prepared for it either. Going through a PMO detox means that, likely for most of our adult (and pre-adult lives) we’ve had the PMO needle in our veins, blurring our realities, poisoning our cognitive abilities. And one sudden moment of clarity — the acknowledgement of the problem, and the potential future without the problem — does not prepare one for this process.

My best streak was 16 days for a long time and then I quit. Recently I gave it another shot and after a couple failed attempts, I am on my 27th day. I am not expecting superpowers or anything, my motivation was 'I should just get rid of at least one addiction' and that I would just be better off. But still, I am having some good things going on now.\n\nMost pronounced change I noticed is that I have a lot more drive to put effort into various aspects of my life. It is not at the level of an elite level athlete's drive to become the best in the world or anything. Just a lot more than before. That drive translates into action as well.\n\nAnyway, I hope I keep this up and wish you guys all the best.\n\nu/kendiminfeykiyim, reddit"),

There was a handful of things that happened yesterday, that really got on my nerves, but I didn’t let them ruin my day.

NEVER let your guard down or quit! this is your path to your pure and real self!\n\nGood night everyone\n\nu/DracOdracir, reddit")

This streak is by far the best one I've ever had. My 2nd best is 4 days. Something I found out during this streak is how to keep beating my urges. Recently I start having really strong urges during the night, that makes me wanting to relapse. But whenever I have an urge, the first thing I do is start telling myself to inhale and exhale. I try to make myself feel comfortable and to relax. I let everything just go through my mind and keep inhaling and exhaling. This immediately kill my urges. Hopefully I helped someone.\n\nu/Dvoise, reddit")

Though this is not an extraordinary achievement, but means a lot to me. Just like everyone I struggled my way till here. I remember fapping 3-4 times a day and then end up feeling shit. I cried inside, but tears didn't come out, I thought all my emotions were dead. Nothing felt exciting, I was depressed and just living a shit life. It took me more than a year to reach this mark and trust me it was hard as fuck. I failed so many times, that I even stopped believing that I would ever be able to control myself.\n\nTomorrow is just a first checkpoint of this journey, I haven't observed many changes in myself yet, but I do know I am a confident and a better person than I was before.\n\nI am so proud of myself that I made it this far. I don't wanna stop now. I will keep going.\n\nThanks for reading !!\n\nu/panpaliyatushar, reddit"),

I lessened watching porn about 5 months ago because i realized how bad it was but often did PMO, then mostly just MO. Exactly 30 days ago I just said 'Fuck it, my mind is powerful and I need to give it the environment it needs to grow' So my first ever streak on hardmode was 30 days and im not gonna stop.

Afterall I did control for so long. I should have some fun?\n\nBeing in a lockdown even now; having no physical interaction with anyone makes it all the more harder. Looking at IG models has started getting annoying. The idea of porn has slowly started disgusting me more. And all this makes me wonder if I am even normal anymore?\n\nI don't care. I feel so damn strong after I successfully kill an urge as I make it to day 30 tonight. This strength in myself is worth everything I have to go through.\n\nI am still not in that zone where the desire has died. It is a fight every single day. And I am going to win it every single day. Writing (reading too) over here, definitely makes the fight a little easier. Stay strong brothers. This is all going to be worth it.\n\nCheers.\n\nu/notmymain566, reddit"),
